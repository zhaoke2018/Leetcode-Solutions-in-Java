# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
Solutions to this question vary from Brute-Force with recursion(O(2^n)), Dynamic Programming(O(n^2)) to Dynamic Programming with Binary Search(O(nlogn)).
Here, I only focus on DP, which is suitable for interview. Though DP with Binary Search is more efficient, it's hard to figure out.

First, if nums is not empty, there must be at least one item, so I create a variable, maxsofar with 1.
Then, I need a new array called maxlen[i], to record the max increasing subsequence length by i, which is the essence of DP.
In the first for loop, there are the subset of Longest Increasing Subsequence, and i aim to find maxsofar.
In the second for loop, I compare nums[j] from nums[0] to nums[i-1] with nums[i], to update maxlen[i].

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        
        int[] maxlen = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(maxlen, 1);
        
        int maxsofar = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    maxlen[i] = Math.max(maxlen[i], maxlen[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            maxsofar = Math.max(maxsofar, maxlen[i]);
        }
        return maxsofar;
    }
}
```
